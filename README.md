# Spring Boot Student API

This is a simple Spring Boot API that manages students. The API has endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting students.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you will need to have Java 8 or higher installed on your system. You can clone this repository and run the `main` method in the `com.training.StudentApiApplication` class.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-api.git
cd student-api
./gradlew bootRun
```

The API will then be accessible at `http://localhost:8090/students`.

## API Endpoints

The API has the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint       | Description                                              |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | /students      | Get a list of all students                               |
| GET    | /students/{id} | Get a specific student by ID                              |
| POST   | /students      | Create a new student                                      |
| PUT    | /students/{id} | Update an existing student by ID                          |
| DELETE | /students/{id} | Delete an existing student by ID and returns the deleted student       |
